Tight Coupling - Loose Coupling
DI


@Component({
  selector: 'app-spiderman',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [],
  templateUrl: './spiderman.component.html',
  styleUrl: './spiderman.component.css',
})
export class SpidermanComponent {
  constructor(private missionService: MissionService) {}
}

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
}) -->This part makes the service injectable so that object is shared between components
-- If not added then a new object will be created of each components



Subject -  Data which is shared
Observable - The one which shares the data
Observer - Receives data


Different between different types of subject
