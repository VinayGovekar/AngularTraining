Unit Testing:

To test functions inside components and service by checking if the output matches with the expected output

JST: Just in Time compiler
Compile all dependencies of a component when the component is compiled

Mocking:
Using dummy dependencies instead of the original when testing a component which has dependencies

spying:
Eg: If component is actually calling service functions or not

testcase: Different scenerios/cases which will be implement in testing.

Jasmine - Framework for testing JS codes

Testrunner - Generates an environment which contains testcases, components on which test cases will be executed and reports to show if testcases are passed or failed\
test cases are written inside test suite

describe("AppComponent test suite",()=>{
beforeEach(()=>{
//this code runs before each test case
})
it("should something",()=>{
//mocking , spying code

expect().tobeEqual(Actualoutput,expected output)

});
it("should test something else",()=>{

})

})



Directives:

Attribute - [disabled] ,etc any attribute which is send to tag  []
Structural - @if @for 
Component - directive with its own template
