StageManagement - 
To check what is the current state of an object 

eg: useState of react

Feature - A project can contain multiple entities like doctors, patients etc

Each of these entity will have a state

To manage these we use stateManagement

To manage all states together we use StoreManagement


Action - to be dispatched to Store
Action is dispatched by component

Action -> type:add,remove
	  payload:Data sent along with action


Store: Each state will have a selector(slice)
Reducer (Manages state inside the store)
(Action listener)


Component -> dispatches Action with Type(add,remove) and payload -> Store 
-> has multiple selectors and each selectors has a reducer (manages state inside store) 
-> has multiple action listners for each action 
and each action does some state management
