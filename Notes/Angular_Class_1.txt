Variables are reference to the actual value
Variables are stored in stack.
Objects are stored in Heap

****ToDo - Is C#,Java,Javascript fully object oriented or not?
Examples of Fully and Partially
In fully OO programming language all values are treated as objects and stored in Heap memory
Variables are stored in stack memory

In Partially OOP primitive data types are not stored as objects

Datatypes - Defines what type of data a variable refer to
Uses - Memory allocation, Operation management

Javascript is dynamically typed language

C# is strictly typed

****ToDo --  Which is better?

Arrays

Homogeneous array - Collection of objects with same datatype

***ToDo - String,Array methods

Object - key value pair

obj ={fname:"Vinay",lname:"Govekar"}
obj.fname

No need of class for object creation in JS

Plain Sorting in javascript is suitable for string 
Eg: [21,5,9,4];
[21, 4, 5, 9]

**** ToDo --  Sorting of Object array
